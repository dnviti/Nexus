```

## Best Practices

### 1. Iterative Development

Start with simple prompts and iterate:

```
Initial: "Create a user management plugin"
     ↓
Better: "Create a user management plugin with CRUD operations"
     ↓
Best: "Create a user management plugin for Nexus Framework with:
      - User CRUD operations with pagination
      - Role-based access control
      - JWT authentication
      - Password reset via email
      - Account activation workflow
      - Audit logging
      - Rate limiting on auth endpoints"
```

### 2. Context Providing

Always provide sufficient context:

```
Context: I'm building a multi-tenant SaaS application using Nexus Framework.
Current plugins: auth_plugin, billing_plugin, notification_plugin
Database: PostgreSQL
Deployment: Kubernetes on AWS

Task: Create a tenant management plugin that integrates with existing plugins.
```

### 3. Code Review Loops

Use AI for continuous code review:

```python
# After each implementation:
prompt = f"""
Review this code change for:
- Consistency with existing codebase
- Performance implications
- Security concerns
- Test coverage

Diff:
{git_diff}

Existing patterns:
{codebase_patterns}
"""
```

## Integration Examples

### GitHub Copilot Integration

```python
# .github/copilot-instructions.md
You are developing plugins for Nexus Framework.
Always:
- Inherit from BasePlugin
- Implement lifecycle methods
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Include type hints
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Follow the project's naming conventions
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-review.yml

jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: AI Review
        run: |
          # Use AI API to review changes
          python scripts/ai_review.py --diff "${{ github.event.pull_request.diff_url }}"
```

### IDE Integration

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "ai-assistant.prompts": {
    "nexus-plugin": "Generate a Nexus Framework plugin that ${input}",
    "nexus-test": "Create tests for this Nexus plugin: ${selectedText}",
    "nexus-docs": "Document this Nexus plugin code: ${selectedText}"
  }
}
```

## Prompt Templates

Include starter code for each file following Nexus conventions.
```

### API Endpoint Generation

```
Generate FastAPI routes for a Nexus plugin that manages [RESOURCE]:

Operations needed:
- List with pagination and filtering

- [ENTITY_2]: [DESCRIPTION]

Requirements:
- Relationships between entities
- Indexes for performance
- Validation rules
- Audit fields (created_at, updated_at, created_by)
- Soft delete support
- Version tracking

Generate:
1. Pydantic schemas
2. Database migration
3. Repository interfaces
4. Query builders
```

### Event Handler Generation

```
Create event handlers for a plugin that needs to:

Listen to:
- [EVENT_1]: [ACTION_TO_TAKE]
- [EVENT_2]: [ACTION_TO_TAKE]

Publish:
- [EVENT_3]: When [CONDITION]
- [EVENT_4]: When [CONDITION]

Include:
- Error recovery
- Retry logic
- Dead letter queue handling
- Event validation
- Idempotency checks
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

```
Let's build a complex plugin step by step.

Step 1: First, let's understand the requirements...
Step 2: Now, let's design the data model...
Step 3: Next, we'll implement the business logic...
Step 4: Then, we'll create the API layer...
Step 5: Finally, we'll add tests and documentation...

[Detailed implementation for each step]
```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning

```
Here are examples of good Nexus plugins:

Example 1: [CODE_EXAMPLE_1]
Example 2: [CODE_EXAMPLE_2]

Now create a similar plugin for [NEW_DOMAIN] following these patterns.
```

### 3. Role-Playing

```
You are a senior developer reviewing a junior's code.
The junior has submitted this Nexus plugin: [CODE]

Provide mentoring feedback that:
- Explains why certain patterns are better
- Shows improved implementations
- Teaches best practices
- Encourages good habits
```

### 4. Iterative Refinement

```
Initial: Generate a basic CRUD plugin
Refine 1: Add validation and error handling
Refine 2: Implement caching layer
Refine 3: Add event publishing
Refine 4: Include monitoring and metrics
Refine 5: Optimize for performance
```

### 5. Cross-Functional Collaboration

```
Simulate a discussion between:
- Backend Developer (focusing on API design)
- Frontend Developer (focusing on usability)
- DevOps Engineer (focusing on deployment)
- Security Expert (focusing on vulnerabilities)

Topic: Designing a new authentication plugin for Nexus Framework

Generate the discussion and final consensus.
